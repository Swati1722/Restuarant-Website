                            <h3>How to make Frenchfries</h3>
                            <hr>
                            Step 1 Chop the potatoes
                            To prepare this easy recipe, you need to make sure that they are cut in the right shape and size. They should neither be too thick, nor too thin and should be cut clean and sharp. The trick is to first slice the potatoes and then cut them lengthwise. You can also use a fries cutter for that long, even shape.
                            <hr>
                            Step 2 Soak cut potatoes in ice-cold water for 10-15 minutes
                            Now, wash the potatoes under running water till they are squeaky clean. Place them in a bowl of iced water for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep them submerged in water or they will turn black.
                            <hr>
                            Step 3 Deep fry the potato fries
                            Now, heat the oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the smoke starts appearing, reduce the flame and allow it to acquire a lower temperature. Now, deep fry the potatoes in batches. Keep the flame low. This will make them crunchy and also help retain their colour.
                            <hr>
                            Step 4 Sprinkle salt and pepper and serve hot
                            Drain excess oil and place them on an absorbent paper. Allow them to cool. Now sprinkle salt and pepper and toss well. Serve immediately with ketchup. They can also be served with burgers and cutlets.
                            <hr>
                            Tips
                            To make those perfect French Fries, add your cut potatoes in ice-cold water for a good 20-30 minutes.
                            For making crispy fries, dry the soaked potatoes twice to thrice in tissue paper and then fry.
                            When making French Fries for a large gathering, half-fry them and keep aside. When you are about to serve, quickly fry them for a second time and you will have perfect French Frie...

                            <h3>How to make Bread Dahi Vada</h3>
                            <hr>
                            Step 1 Prepare the dal batter
                            Take yellow moong and urad dal together in a bowl and wash them well. Soak them together for about 8-10 hours or overnight. Next day, when the dals are soaked, drain the water and keep aside. Now, in a blender jar, add the soaked dals, green chillies, ginger, asafoetida, salt, baking soda, and a little water. Grind them to a fine paste and transfer to a bowl. Using a whisker, whisk well this paste until the paste is light and fluffy. Once done, keep aside until required.
                            <hr>
                            Step 2 Prepare the filling
                            Now, take a bowl and mix chopped almonds, cashews, raisins, and desiccated coconut.
                            <hr>
                            Step 3 Make stuffed vadas
                            Next, take a bread slice and cut the corners of each slice. Using a little water, keep the ends of the whole bread wet. Add a little filling in the centre and close the ends to make a round ball. Press the ball a little to give it a Tikki like shape. Using the same process, prepare more such vadas.
                            <hr>
                            Step 4 Fry the Bread Vadas
                            Put a wok or kadhai over medium flame and heat oil in it. When the oil is hot enough, dip a vada in the dal batter. Now, grease your hands and take out the dipped vada and place it in the hot oil. Dip more such vadas in the batter and fry all the vadas. Once done, place them on tissue papers that will soak the extra oil.
                            <hr>
                            Step 5 Soak the vadas in the curd mixture
                            This step will help you in soaking the fried vadas. Take a large bowl and add ½ cup curd, sugar, salt, water and asafoetida. Whisk well all the ingredients and make sure you use hung curd for this soaking. When this mixture is ready, put the vadas in it and soak them for 5-7 minutes. Make sure you don’t soak these vadas for too long, as this can make your vadas soggy.
                            <hr>
                            Step 6 Make your Dahi Vada Chaat
                            While your vadas are soaking, take a bowl and whisk the curd well with black salt, salt and sugar. Once done, take out the soaked vadas and gently press them a little. Place these vadas on a plate, and pour the curd over them. Over this, sprinkle the spices and pour tamarind chutney over them. Finally, garnish your chaat with coriander leave, pomegranate seeds, garam masala, chaat masala powder and some boondi. Serve the chaat chilled.

                            Step 1 Knead the dough and soak moong dal for 2 hours
                            Take a large bowl and mix together whole wheat flour, semolina, gram flour and ghee. Using a little water, knead the mixture to a thick, pliable dough. Once done, cover the dough with a damp cloth and keep it aside for preparing the kachori. Afterwards, soak moong dal in a bowl for 2 hours in a large bowl. Once done, drain the extra water and keep it aside.
                            <hr>
                            Step 2 Stir fry the dal and when cooled, grind into coarse mixture
                            Next, put a frying pan over medium flame and heat a little ghee in it. Once the ghee is melted, add the soaked moong dal in it and stir fry for a minute. Once fried a bit, turn off the flame and transfer the fried dal to a grinder jar. When the dal is cool enough to handle, grind to form a coarse mixture. Then, add all the filling ingredients into the grinding jar and grind them roughly.
                            <hr>
                            Step 3 Make a small paratha and deep fry, then make a medium hole in between
                            Now, take out a small portion of the prepared dough and using a rolling pin, roll it into a small puri. Just like stuffed paratha, fill it with a tablespoon of the filling and fold well. Then, using a little dry flour, roll the puri again. Meanwhile, put a kadhai on high flame and heat refined oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add this puri in it and deep fry until the puri is crisp and golden. Once fried, put it on a napkin to soak the extra oil. Once done, make a hole in the centre.
                            <hr>
                            Step 4 Add all the filling ingredients and garnish with sev
                            Now, take a mixing bowl and add boiled potatoes in it along with chana and boiled moong sprouts. Mix them with yoghurt, green chutney, sweet tamarind chutney, chaat masala powder, chopped coriander leaves, onion, salt and green chillies. Then, fill the kachori with this mixture and garnish with hung curd, green chutney, sweet tamarind chutney, chaat masala powder, salt, coriander leaves, crushed papdis and cumin powder. Make the final garnishing of sev.
                            <hr>
                            Step 5 Serve

                            Step 1 Prepare the masala
                            To begin, wash your chicken thoroughly with fresh water and pat it dry. Now take a pan and add ghee or oil to it. Add in your whole spices like cinnamon, green cardamom and cloves and let these roast for 40 seconds in the oil. Add the green chillies, sliced onions, saute them until they turn translucent. Then add the ginger-garlic paste and finely chopped tomatoes. Add salt to cook the tomatoes quickly.

                            Step 2 Add the chicken and cook
                            At this point, add in the chicken and let it cook until it changes colour. Add all the spices, stir well and let it cook evenly on all sides. Now add the curd and close the lid.

                            Step 3 Add cashew-coconut paste, cook and serve!
                            Meanwhile, grind the cashews with coconut flesh and make a fine paste by adding a little bit of water as required in the grinder. Once you see the oil starts separating from the chicken, add this paste and ½ cup of water with chopped coriander leaves. Cover and cook for the next 5 minutes. Serve with hot rotis!

                            Step 1 Wash and clean the chicken
                            To make Masala Chicken, first thoroughly wash the chicken under running water. Now put it in some warm salted water and allow it to rest for 10 minutes and throw the water away and wash again. This helps to remove the smell of the chicken.
                            <hr>
                            Step 2 Saute whole spices
                            Add oil and ghee in pan and heat over medium flame. When the oil is hot enough, add bay leaves and both the cardamom and cinnamon. Saute for a minute and then add finely chopped onion into it. Cook till onions turn pink. Then add the ginger-garlic paste. Fry for a minute and then add chicken pieces in it. Cook chicken for 2-3 minutes until it turns white.

                            Step 3 Add spices in frying chicken
                            Quickly, add red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric, cumin powder, and salt to taste. Stir to mix all the ingredients well with the chicken. Cook for a minute and then add finely chopped tomatoes and green chillies (slit and halved). Now reduce the flame and cook covered for 6-7 minutes and then uncovered till the chicken is browned.
                            <hr>
                            Step 4 Cook for 2-4 minutes with closed lid and serve hot
                            Add one cup water and cover the pan with a lid and cook for 2-4 minutes until the chicken is tender and soft. Remove the lid and garnish with garam masala powder, coriander leaves, kasoori methi powder and cook on high flame till the oil separates. Your Masala Chicken or Chicken Masala is ready. Enjoy with butter naan, rice or roti.
